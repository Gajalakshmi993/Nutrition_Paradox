**Problem Statement:**

Task is to investigate the complex challenge of undernutrition and overnutrition across different countries, age groups, and genders. You will use publicly available WHO data to uncover trends, patterns, and disparities in obesity and malnutrition rates around the world. Your end goal is to derive meaningful insights that can inform global health strategies and help tackle the nutritional paradox of rising obesity and persistent malnutrition.
**Business Use Cases**
Nutrition Risk Monitoring: Identify countries with extremely high obesity or malnutrition levels, flagging them for public health intervention.
Demographic Disparity Analysis: Understand how gender and age groups contribute differently to obesity and malnutrition statistics.
Data-Driven Policy Planning: Help policymakers prioritize regions for funding and nutrition-related programs based on multi-dimensional data.
Comparative Region Analysis: Enable researchers to compare regional trends and draw correlations between health indicators and socio-economic conditions.
Public Health Reporting: Provide government or NGOs with a summarized SQL + Power BI dashboard showing country-level nutrition trends.
